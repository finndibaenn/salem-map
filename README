This tool is used to help merging session maps created from Ender's client for the Salem Game (http://salemthegame.com).

It was originally inspired by (salem-map-tool, at https://code.google.com/p/salem-map-tool/) but differs in that it will try to automatically find matches in your session maps.
This is achieved by hashing the files and looking for files with same hashes.

How to use
- have java installed (was tested with java7)
- double click the jar file
- By default, the tool will look for salem maps in $USER_HOME$/Salem/map. If you have connect on multiple servers it should ask you to choose one. If it doesn't find any suitable directory, you will be given a change to choose one. This must be the parent directory of the sessions directories.
- When merging sessions, both original session directories will be emptied/deleted, and a new directory will be created with today's date. For each tile existing in both sessions, the more recent one will be kept (and last modified date preserved).

Known issues
- will get confused by open water (maps with tiles of only water), as they are all identical
- get confused when the client changes the colors/hues of tiles, (something which recently happened). In that case you're down to the above linked salem-map tool.
